<h1>My first Challenge</h1> 

- Throughout the challenge, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages were utilized to create a text encryptor. Various tools provided by each programming language were implemented during the process.
  
- HTML was used to structure the page using elements such as header, textarea, main, section, button, among others. These elements formed the foundation of the user interface and enabled interaction with the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
  
- With CSS, the page was customized with backgrounds, sizes, positions, margins, colors, images, among others, to achieve an attractive, structured, and coherent visualization in accordance with the challenge requirements.
  
- In the JavaScript section, tools like document.querySelector() were used to manipulate DOM elements, and functions were implemented to encrypt or decrypt the text, as well as to display the result in another <textarea> and copy it to the clipboard.
  
- This project allowed me to gain practical experience in web development and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned to tackle technical challenges, implement effective solutions, and work efficiently with the tools provided by each programming language."
